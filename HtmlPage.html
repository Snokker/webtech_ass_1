        <h1>The Life of Sylvester Stone</h1>
        <h3> We don't know where Sylvester came from, or where he is going, but we do know he needs our help! </h3>
        <p>
            We found him next to a bunch of stray cats and dogs (who were clearly better of than Sylvester), and even though he couldn't talk, or hear or anything that has to do with senses, we felt his cry for help.
